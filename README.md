## Blenderbot Ported to Keras
Building open-domain chatbots is a challenging area for machine learning research. The Blenderbot model, initially developed in PyTorch, has demonstrated remarkable performance in engaging and human-like conversations. With the recent support of Keras for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends, we aim to port the Blenderbot model into Keras, enhancing accessibility and usability across different machine learning frameworks.

The Blenderbot model encapsulates the essence of good conversation by seamlessly blending various conversational skills such as providing engaging talking points, active listening, asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy, and personality. Through scaling neural models with an increasing number of parameters and training data, the Blenderbot variants with 90M, 2.7B, and 9.4B parameters have shown superior performance in multi-turn dialogues.

Our project focuses on translating the original Blenderbot architecture and training procedures into Keras, ensuring compatibility and consistency across different backend frameworks. By making the Blenderbot model and code publicly available in Keras, we aim to facilitate further research and development in conversational AI.


## Key Features
- Porting the Blenderbot model to Keras with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backend support.
- Ensuring compatibility and consistency across different backend frameworks.
- Providing pre-trained Blenderbot variants with varying parameter sizes (90M, 2.7B, and 9.4B). **Note: It currently supports 400M distilled version only for now!).**
- Facilitating research and development in open-domain chatbots and conversational AI.

## Future Work

By porting Blenderbot to Keras, we aim to democratize access to state-of-the-art conversational models across different machine-learning frameworks.
Providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in developing and evaluating chatbot systems.
